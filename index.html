    <h3>The Alap Demo...</h3>

    <p>
      Hello! This is a quick demo page for alap. Alap enables attaching menus to links.
    </p>

    <p>
      Traditionally, a link has one target. We might go to a YouTube page for someone such as <a target="fromalap"
        href="https://www.youtube.com/user/caseyneistat">Casey Neistat.</a> It works fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      With alap, we can say "here are some of my <a id="faveyt" class="alap"
        href="https://www.youtube.com/user/caseyneistat" data-alap-linkitems=".youtube">favorite YouTube creators</a>"
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a bit like an in-place menu...but more flexible and powerful.
    </p>

    <p>
      I like <a id="cars1" class="alap" data-alap-linkitems="bmwe36, vwbug">cars</a>,
      <a id="beer1" class="alap" data-alap-linkitems="sierranevada, fosters, lagunitas">beer</a>, and
      <a id="cities1" class="alap city" data-alap-linkitems="visitbrooklyn, sydneyoz, melbournepz">cities.</a>
      There is so much to say about any of those topics, but where to put all of the links for them? ...
    </p>

    <p>
      Imagine I have a blob of data (a JSON file that gets converted to a JavaScript object) about links. Each bit of it
      contains:

      <ul>
        <li>a link id (its name, the property)</li>
        <li>a label (what you see on the page)</li>
        <li>a url (where it should go)</li>
        <li>a list of tags (such as
          <a id="nyctags" class="alap" data-alap-linkitems=".nyc">"nyc"</a> or <a id="bridgetags" class="alap"
            data-alap-linkitems=".bridge">"bridge"</a>)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <div>
      <p>Here is a an example of a couple of entries:</p>
      <pre>
            <code> 
    vwbug: {
      label: "VW Bug",
      url: "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Beetle",
      tags: ["vw", "car", "germany"]
    },

    sierranevada: {
      label: "Sierra Nevada",
      url: "http://www.sierranevada.com/",
      tags: ["beer", "ale"]
    }
            </code>
          </pre>
    </div>


    <p>
      example: here are some <a id="sfactivities" class="alap"
        data-alap-linkitems="sanfrancisco, ferrybuilding, acmebread, sfchinatown, gbpizza, gbpizza_photos, parkchalet">things
        you should
        check out</a> in San Francisco
    </p>




    <p>
      So far, so good. We can build up a list of links by using the ids of properties that are available in our JSON
      configuration object. I use a "data-alap-linkitems" attribute to store the references for what I want from the
      JSON data:
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code>
    &lt;a id="cars1" class="alap" data-alap-linkitems="bmwe36, vwbug"&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt;
        </code>
      </pre>

    <p>
      To be clear, one can think of the properties in the JSON object as IDs for each possible target. There is another
      sense of IDs, and that is over on the DOM/HTML side... we can refer to elsewhere in our document, and grab the
      same
      list of targets that they use.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Grabbing info from other HTML link IDs</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      My first example mentioned cars and cities. Their DOM IDs on this page are #cars1 and #cities1. If I wanted to
      have
      a link that showed everything they list, I could certainly list out all of the individual items: (bmwe36, vwbug,
      visitbrooklyn, sydneyoz, melbournepz) ...
    </p>

    <p>
      ... yeah, I could. But I could just say this: <a id="carcity1" class="alap"
        data-alap-linkitems="#cars1, #cities1">#cars1, #cities1</a>, and be done with it. If the definition changes in
      those
      IDs (someone adds a car or city), I would pick that up here for free.
    </p>

    <p>
      I can also pick up definitions recursively. If I were bringing in the contents of #cars1, and it referred to
      #germancars, I would get those definitions as well (and so on). Alap keeps track of what it has seen, and
      wont get into any endless loops while gathering info.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Tags, and combining them</>
    </p>

    <p>
      Referring to items is a good start. Referring to other IDs and grabbing all of the items that they know about
      improves things. If you know about CSS, you are familiar with classes. Same idea here: let's talk about Tags.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is a basic tag: <a id="nyctag1" class="alap" data-alap-linkitems=".nyc">"NYC"</a>. It simply gathers all of
      the links that have a tag that matches "nyc". It looks like this:
    </p>

    <code>
      &lt;a id="nyctag1" class="alap" data-alap-linkitems=".nyc"&lt;/a&gt;
    </code>
    </p>

    <p>
      Ok, so we can refer to a few of them, and build up quite a list. Let's try <a id="nycsydlon" class="alap"
        data-alap-linkitems=".sydney, .nyc, .london">Sydney, NYC, and London</a>. (that element is "#nycsydlon")
    </p>

    <p>
      So far, I've shown a bit about referring to items in the data known to the page, and that we can go grab the
      items
      from elsewhere, and do so recursively. I've also shown the basic bit about tags: that you use them to build up
      quite a list. I suppose I can also show that I can get tags from elsewhere, such as that big <a id="checknsl"
        class="alap" data-alap-linkitems="#nycsydlon">"nycsydlondon one..."</a> (I'm picking up the contents of
      "#nycsydlon")
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>
        What we know so far...
      </strong>

      <ul>
        <li>properties in JSON are an id for defining an individual target, such as "acrecoffee"</li>
        <li>in our JSON object, each definition might have some tags, such as "cafe, coffee", in our data attribute, we
          use the '.' (think of CSS Classes) to refer to a class. If we say ".coffee", we pick up all of the entries
          that contain a tag of "coffee".</li>
        <li>using an #id (with '#') means "go to some other DOM element on the page, grab the data attribute from there,
          and use it here".</li>
        <li>these can all be combined in a data attribute. "#cities1 #bridges1 acrecoffee .beer" would be valid. It all
          goes towards building up a list for a menu.</li>
      </ul>

    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Expressions with Tags: And, OR, and Without</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      If we stopped with the combinations of using item ids, tags, and picking up more definitions from other DOM
      elements, that would be a lot of functionality. It gets better though, with simple expressions that let us do AND,
      OR, and WITHOUT operations. (I need to confirm that this works outside of tags.. I think it does, but am trying to
      get this written at the moment)
    </p>

    <p>
      As you can guess, building up groups of tags can yield some pretty large lists. We really want more
      control. Let's go for that!
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Here is <a id="nyctag" class="alap" data-alap-linkitems=".nyc">"nyc"</a></li>
        <li>Here is <a id="nycpark" class="alap" data-alap-linkitems=".park">"park"</a></li>
        <li>Here is <a id="nycbrooklyn" class="alap" data-alap-linkitems=".brooklyn">"brooklyn"</a></li>
        <li>and ... <a id="bridgetags" class="alap" data-alap-linkitems=".bridge">"bridge"</a></li>

        <li>... now it gets fun...</li>

        <li><a id="nycandbridge" class="alap" data-alap-linkitems=".nyc + .bridge">"nyc AND bridge (+)"</a></li>
        <li><a id="nycwobridge" class="alap" data-alap-linkitems=".nyc - .bridge">"nyc WITHOUT bridge (-)"</a></li>
        <li><a id="nycorbridge" class="alap" data-alap-linkitems=".nyc | .bridge">"nyc OR bridge (|)"</a></li>
        <li><a id="nycorbridgenolon" class="alap" data-alap-linkitems=".nyc | .bridge - .london">"nyc OR bridge,
            without
            London (| and -)"</a></li>
      </ul>
    </p>


    <p>
      <strong>
        Expression Recap
      </strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      You can say:
      <ul>
        <li>I want the list of what matches "this" tag AND "that" tag. (".nyc + .bridge")</li>
        <li>I want whatever matches "this" OR "that" (".nyc | .bridge")</li>
        <li>I want the list of "this", and get rid of the items that match "that" (".nyc - .bridge")</li>
      </ul>

      Alap will look through these expressions from left to right. So you could say something like "Show me the
      links for all of the bridges you know of, but toss out the ones from NYC and London":<br />
      <a id="bridgenonycnolon" class="alap" data-alap-linkitems=".bridge - .nyc - .london">".bridges - .nyc -
        .london"</a>
